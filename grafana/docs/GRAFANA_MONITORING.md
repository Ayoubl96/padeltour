# 📊 Grafana Monitoring Setup

Your Grafana monitoring files have been organized in the `/grafana/` folder.

## 🗂️ What Was Cleaned Up

✅ **Moved working files** to organized structure  
✅ **Removed broken dashboard files** that didn't work  
✅ **Organized documentation** in proper folders  
✅ **Clean main directory** - no more clutter  

## 🚀 Quick Start

### TL;DR - Get Started Now:

1. **Test connection**: Import `/grafana/dashboards/debug.json`
2. **Basic monitoring**: Import `/grafana/dashboards/simple.json`  
3. **Advanced features**: Import `/grafana/dashboards/standard.json`
